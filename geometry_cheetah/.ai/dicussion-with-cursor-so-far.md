# Geometry Cheetah Game Development Discussion Summary

## Project Overview
This conversation covers the development and enhancement of a Geometry Cheetah game project, which is a platform-based game similar to Geometry Dash. The project is built using Python with Pygame and runs in a virtual environment on macOS.

## Initial Setup and Basic Game
- **Environment**: Python 3 with Pygame 2.6.1 on macOS (darwin 24.5.0)
- **Project Structure**: Located in `/Users/arianaluong/AAAI/Games/geometry_cheetah/`
- **Virtual Environment**: `geometry_cheetah_env` with proper activation scripts
- **Initial Game**: Basic platform-based gameplay with a cheetah character

## Progressive Enhancements

### 1. Multiple Levels and Platform Improvements
- Added 5 balanced levels with progressively increasing difficulty
- Implemented 6 different platform types designed for easier jumping
- Improved cheetah character appearance with better graphics
- Enhanced collision detection with larger collision boxes
- Added slower moving platforms and longer disappearing timers

### 2. Audio Integration
- Added background music and sound effects
- Implemented jump, land, death, score, and level complete sounds
- Added menu selection sounds and bounce effects
- Created `geometry_cheetah_audio.py` version

### 3. Power-ups System
- **Extra Life**: Provides additional lives to the player
- **Flying**: Allows temporary flight ability
- **Invincibility**: Makes the cheetah temporarily invulnerable
- **Double Jump**: Enables double jumping capability
- **Slow Time**: Slows down game time for easier navigation
- **Magnet**: Attracts collectibles to the player

### 4. Enhanced Backgrounds
- Created multiple parallax layers for depth
- Added dynamic aurora and lightning effects
- Implemented detailed mountains, clouds, and stars
- Added atmospheric scattering effects
- Integrated with existing power-ups and gameplay

### 5. Nature-Themed Obstacles
- Replaced simple spikes and rectangles with detailed rocks
- Added various rock types: small, large, clusters, moving rocks, boulders
- Implemented spiky bushes with animated swaying and thorns
- Fixed platform collision bug in cheetah update method
- Created nature-themed version with enhanced backgrounds

### 6. Cloud Platform System
- Replaced traditional platforms with floating clouds
- Multiple cloud types: small, medium, large, moving, disappearing, bouncy, storm clouds
- Added detailed cloud drawings and animations
- Implemented lightning effects and bouncing mechanics
- Created cloud-themed version launcher

## Technical Issues and Solutions

### Audio Module Issue
- Encountered `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'` when trying to run audio version
- Error: `Could not load sounds: sndarray module not available`
- Issue: `name 'Background' is not defined` in audio version
- **Status**: Audio version needs numpy dependency and Background class fix

### Performance Issue
- Cloud version experienced performance problems during background drawing
- Likely caused by gradient calculation in EnhancedBackground class
- **Status**: Performance optimization needed for cloud version

## Current Status
- **Working Versions**: Original, Enhanced, Nature, and Cloud versions
- **Issues**: Audio version has dependency and class definition problems
- **Performance**: Cloud version needs optimization for background rendering
- **Environment**: Properly configured Python 3 virtual environment with Pygame 2.6.1

## Key Features Implemented
1. **Multi-level progression system**
2. **Enhanced graphics and animations**
3. **Comprehensive power-up system**
4. **Advanced background effects**
5. **Nature and cloud-themed obstacles**
6. **Sound effects and music (partially working)**
7. **Multiple game modes and themes**

## Next Steps
1. Fix audio version dependencies (add numpy to requirements)
2. Resolve Background class definition issue in audio version
3. Optimize cloud version performance
4. Test all versions for consistency
5. Consider adding more power-ups or game modes

## Technical Environment
- **OS**: macOS (darwin 24.5.0)
- **Python**: 3.13.5
- **Pygame**: 2.6.1
- **Shell**: /bin/zsh
- **Virtual Environment**: geometry_cheetah_env
- **Working Directory**: /Users/arianaluong/AAAI/Games/geometry_cheetah
