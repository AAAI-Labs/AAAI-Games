# Game Projects Management Rules

## Core Rules for Game Development

### 1. Python Version Requirement

- **ALWAYS use Python 3** for all game development
- Never use Python 2 for new games

### 2. Project Structure

- **Each game must be in a separate folder** with a descriptive name
- Each game folder should be self-contained

### 3. Virtual Environment Management

- **Create a separate virtual environment for each game**
- Always activate the virtual environment before development

### 4. Dependencies Management

- **Every game must have a `requirements.txt` file**
- Include common dependencies such as pygame
